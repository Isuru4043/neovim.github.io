Bram is one of my heroes. That's literal and recursive: when I say it,
internally I check before making a frivolous claim, which is a feature of this
particular role-model; "What would Bram do?" is a fixture in me which informs my
choices.

Those who studied `vim_dev` and the Vim source and docs, accumulated treasure
from a stream of copious messages and spare impressions. But also from what he
omitted: he never appealed to sensationalism or personal judgements.

Even when treated rudely, Bram usually responded only to advance his
understanding of a problem to solve. Bram was one of those humans quietly
providing deep value to the universe, but there was no parade and little
celebrity.

Bram was anchored to reality, directly interested in results and adjusting what
produced them. The "Problem/Solution" mantra in his commit messages is simple
yet profoundly effective. He used that approach to help [people in
Uganda](https://www.moolenaar.net/albums.html), managing resources directly
instead of abstractly.

Bram's principles (as I observed them) extended beyond mere technical
craftsmanship. The ability to adopt a position of *modesty* is a mind-trick that
channels an endeavor through a "narrow waist", a voluntary constraint. That lens
can create a more composable and powerful result. Plugins like
[unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) riff on the theme. And
this touches on a central point: the main utility—not ideology, but _utility_—of
"lifestyle software" like Emacs and Vim, is that the ecosystem is alive, and has
escape velocity, so its momentum is self-perpetuated.

Neovim has always been intentionally positioned as a derivative of Vim, which
means simultaneously it both continues and diverges from Vim. I'm convinced that
[forks create energy](https://twitter.com/justinmk/status/1671916719143526400)
rather than destroy it. So although we can't deliver Vim without Bram, we can
continue some essential parts:

- [Maintenance](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-maintain):
  Experimentation is good, and the world needs creative destruction and playful
  failures. But Neovim does not represent lust for the new ("neomania").
- [Documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-documented):
  the habits of Vim documentation are obvious, this is one of the biggest gains
  that Nvim acquired by building on vim.
- Extensibility: Bram's own [Agide](http://www.agide.org) project aspired to
  a similar sort of extensibility as Neovim:
  > Agide is not a monolitic application. Separate tools can be plugged in. Thus
  > you are not forced to use one editor. ... Each tool implements part of the
  > plugin interface.
- [Embedding](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#design-not): Vim's
  [:help design-not](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/531da5955e03afadb2f0cf72264fe8deb4bf430e/runtime/doc/develop.txt#L145-L153)
  for most of its life proclaimed this tenet of Neovim:
  > Vim is not a shell or an Operating System. ...  This should work the other way
  > around: Use Vim as a component from a shell or in an IDE.

And another thing: Bram didn't take himself too seriously. He had his own sense
of humor.

Neovim is a monument to Vim and Bram. We should be pragmatic, not dogmatic; we
should remember what the goal is, and compare our actions to the results.
